### Basic Yelp client

This is a headless example of how to implement an OAuth 1.0a Yelp API client. The Yelp API provides an application token that allows applications to make unauthenticated requests to their search API.

### Next steps

- Check out `BusinessesViewController.swift` to see how to use the `Business` model.

### Sample request

**Basic search with query**

```
Business.searchWithTerm("Thai", completion: { (businesses: [Business]!, error: NSError!) -> Void in
    self.businesses = businesses
    
    for business in businesses {
        print(business.name!)
        print(business.address!)
    }
})
```

**Advanced search with categories, sort, and deal filters**

```
Business.searchWithTerm("Restaurants", sort: .Distance, categories: ["asianfusion", "burgers"], deals: true) { (businesses: [Business]!, error: NSError!) -> Void in

    for business in businesses {
        print(business.name!)
        print(business.address!)
    }
}
```
